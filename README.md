Use your favorite management software to install the below software like\
_[Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), etc_

→ [**Uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
> ```Bash

- → [**Kanata**](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata?tab=readme-ov-file)
	- _Cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows_
 	- - **Main** configurates here -> [**MODS KEYSWORDS**](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/home-row-mods)
    - _To facilitate faster coding, as well as maintaining hand health_

→ [**Yazi**](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)
	- _Fast terminal file manager written in Rust_

>```bash
> scoop install yazi
>```

>```bash
> winget install sxyazi.yazi
>```

Install the optional dependencies (recommended)
>```bash
> winget install Gyan.FFmpeg 7zip.7zip jqlang.jq sharkdp.fd BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC junegunn.fzf ajeetdsouza.zoxide ImageMagick.ImageMagick
>```
>```bash
> scoop install ffmpeg 7zip jq poppler fd ripgrep fzf zoxide resvg imagemagick
>```

Yazi relies on file(1) to detect the mime-type of the file, and the easiest and most reliable way to get it on Windows is to install Git for Windows and use the file.exe that comes with it.
```txt
    Install Git for Windows by running the official installer, or through your package manager of choice.

    To allow Yazi to use file(1), add <Git_Installed_Directory>\usr\bin\file.exe to your YAZI_FILE_ONE environment variable, which differs depending on how you installed Git:
        If you installed Git with the installer, it would be C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\file.exe.
        If you installed Git with Scoop, it would be C:\Users\<Username>\scoop\apps\git\current\usr\bin\file.exe.
    Restart your terminal.
```
